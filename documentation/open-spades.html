<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Open Spades is a partnership card game with yourself and 3 computer players.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc10"></a>Players</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The four players are teamed up in pairs, North and South are a team and East and West are a team. The player will always be in the South position. Scoring, wining, and loosing is done as a team.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc11"></a>52 Ranked Cards</b></h2>
<p class="p2">D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, DJ, DQ, DK, DA, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, CJ, CQ, CK, CA, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, HJ, HQ, HK, HA, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, SJ, SQ, SK, SA</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc12"></a>Dealing</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The dealer is chosen at random and the next dealer will be to his left (clockwise). The cards are dealt in a clockwise order until all 52 cards have been dealt and each player has 13 cards.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc13"></a>Misdeal</b></h2>
<p class="p2">If dealt one or no spades, a “deficient hand” a player may choose to request that the cards be dealt again or to keep the cards they have. A player may desire to keep a deficient hand so that they may bid Nil and go for a bonus.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc14"></a>Bidding</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Beginning on the dealer’s left, each player “bids” the number of tricks they believe they can take during the hand. The bids of each team are added together and the combined bid is the goal for that team’s hand, this is their “contract”. For example: North bids 4 and South bids 2, as a team they need to take 6 tricks by the end of the hand to not be penalized. In any given hand there is a total of 13 tricks to be taken, if all the tricks bid by the players is greater than 13 then someone is guaranteed to be short while if there is less than 13 bids then someone is guaranteed to be over. A contract is known as a “Fullfilled Contract” when a team takes the number of tricks they have bid and when they are unable to take the number of tricks bid the contract is known as a “Set Contract”.</p>
<p class="p2">A player may choose to bid “Nil” which is 0 tricks. If they succeed in taking no tricks during the hand there is a bonus awarded, but if they take any tricks there is a penalty.</p>
<p class="p2">If a player’s team is loosing by 100 or more points they may bid a “Blind Nil” before looking at their cards. After bidding but before the first card is played the blind nil player passes 2 cards, preferably their highest ranked cards, face down to their teammate who picks them up and then gives back 2 cards, preferably their lowest ranked cards. If they succeed in taking no tricks during the hand there is a large bonus awarded, but if they take any tricks there is a large penalty.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc15"></a>Playing the Hand</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The player to the dealer’s left leads with any card except a spade. Moving clockwise, to each players left, each player lays a card down of matching suit, if the player does not have a card matching the suit they may play any card.</p>
<p class="p2">The four cards played during a turn <span class="s1">[todo: need a better word here]</span> are known as a “trick”.</p>
<p class="p2">The trick is won by the highest ranking card of the same suit led, a trick containing a spade, known as a “Trump Spade”, is won be the highest ranked spade played. Playing the first spade is also known as “breaking spades”.</p>
<p class="p2">The winner of each trick leads the next.</p>
<p class="p2">Spades may not be led until someone has played a spade to win a trick or the player has only spades left in their hand.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc16"></a>Scoring</b></h2>
<p class="p2">A team that takes as may tricks as they have bid, or contracted for, gets a score of 10 times its bid. Each trick over their bid get an additional 1 point and is known as a “bag”. For example: North and South bid 7 and won 9 tricks they get a score of 72, (7*10)+2.</p>
<p class="p2">If a team does not have as many tricks as they bid, a set contract, gets a score of negative 10 times its bid. For example: East and West have a score of 53 and bid 6, they win 5 tricks for a score of −60 which lowers their previous score of 53 to −7, 53+((6*10)-1).</p>
<p class="p2">If a nil bid is successful, the player took no tricks, then their team receives 100 points which is added to the teammates points. For example: North bid Nil and didn’t take any tricks while South bid 3 and took 3 tricks their total would be 100+30 for a team total of 130. On the other hand if North bid Nil and din’t take any tricks while South bid 7 and took only 5 then their total would be 100-70 for a team total of 30.</p>
<p class="p2">If a nil bid is unsuccessful, the player took at least one trick, then their team receives −100 points plus the number of tricks that player took. For example: North bid Nil and takes 2 tricks while South bids 3 and takes 3 then their team score is −100+2+30= −68.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Tricks taken by a player who bid nil are not counted towards their teammate’s bid. For example: North bid nil and takes 1 trick while South bids 2 and takes 1, North takes the −100 penalty plus 1 and South takes the −20 point penalty for a total of −119 and one bag. <span class="s1">[Is this is a case where keeping separate count of the bags is necessary]</span></p>
<p class="p2">A blind nil scores 200 points if successful and −200 if not.</p>
<p class="p2">The game is won when a team reaches 500 points or pushes the opposing team to a score of −200 or lower.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Cochin"><b><a id="doc17"></a>Bags</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Taking more tricks than were bid is known as “Sandbagging” and a team accumulates one bag for every trick over their bid. When a team has accumulated 10 bags they loose 100 points. For an extreme example: North bids 1 and takes 6 tricks while South bids nil and takes 5, their score will be (10+5)+(-100+5)-100=-180. North received 10 for making the bid and 5 for the bags, South received −100 for bidding nil and taking tricks, +5 for the tricks taken, and the team takes an additional −100 points for having 10 bags.</p>
<p class="p2">A more common example would be the 6<span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span> trick played and the North/South team has 184 points with 6 bags. North bids 2 and takes 4 tricks while South bids 1 and takes 3 tricks. Together they bid 3 tricks which they made for 30 points and they have 4 tricks over their bid, bags, which when added to the 6 bags they already have gives them 10 making their score for the hand 34-100=-64 for a total score of 120.</p>
